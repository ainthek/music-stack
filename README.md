Just trying to document my music stack (I always forget after half year of not playing).

# Software

## Capo

<http://supermegaultragroovy.com/products/capo/>

I use this more than Riffstation for detecting chords,
and even for play along. I have made most of "my" tabs with this.


## Riffstation 

<http://www.riffstation.com>

I have purchased this before capo, but I use it less and less.
I miss some feature present in capo.

## Guitar Pro

Just received version 7, and playing with it. Proud owner of 70E licence for version 6.
