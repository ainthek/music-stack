# music-stack

Just trying to document my music stack (I always forget after half year of not playing).

![so far](./music.png)

# Software

## GarageBand
Using as DAW for most of recordings. 

Installed <https://lepouplugins.blogspot.sk> LePou plugins (AMPS) but no big success with these sounds so far (no time to experiment)


## Zoom Edit&Share

Much easier to control my G2Nu from comp then with buttons

## Capo

<http://supermegaultragroovy.com/products/capo/>

I use this more than Riffstation for detecting chords,
and even for play along. I have made most of "my" tabs with this.


## Riffstation 

<http://www.riffstation.com>

I have purchased this before capo, but I use it less and less.
I miss some feature present in capo.

## Guitar Pro

Just received version 7, and playing with it. Proud owner of 70E licence for version 6.

# Tab Web Sites 

## ultimate-guitar.com
<https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/>, but I'm angry with their "complete song policy". My tabs are these <https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/contribution/12977315-a.in.the.k/tabs>

## TabPro 
One day and have payed for this, but nothing special, most of tabs are "stolen" from elsewhere anyway.
